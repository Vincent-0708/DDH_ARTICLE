# DDH_ARTICLE

Here is the code from which I extract the code snippets of this article <Lien de l'article>

It is supposed to represent some parts of a pizza restaurant with a DDH approach. 

Warning : this code is not executable. Its only aim is to contains examples needed for the article. That's why some of the files are almost empty. They just exist in order that elements needed in other files are defined. However, some parts can be interesting to read because they show how concepts interact together, how you may want to realize you file tree,..

Files without interest are : 
- generate-random-string-id.ts
- is-data-from-user-clean.ts
- phone-number.value-object.ts
- pizza-price.value-object.ts
- pizza-command-price.value-object.ts
- fidelity-account.entity.ts
- fidelity-point.value-object.ts
